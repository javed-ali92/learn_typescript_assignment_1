// Question 13

let transpotation : string [] = ["Honda", "Suzuki", "Kawasaki"];
transpotation.map((items) => console.log(`mujhy bike may pasand ha ${items}`));

// In this code, we have an array called transportation that stores several examples of my favorite 
// modes of transportation.

// We then use a for loop to iterate over each element in the transportation array. 
// Inside the loop, we create a transportation variable that stores each transportation item.

// Finally, we use console.log() to print a statement about each item in the list, 
// using string interpolation to include the transportation item in the sentence.
