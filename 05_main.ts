// Question 5


let qoute: string = "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new";
let Famous_Person: string = "Albert Einstein once said";
console.log(`"${Famous_Person}" - ${qoute}`);

// In this code, we have a famous_person variable that stores the name of the famous person, 
// an quote variable that stores the famous quote, and a message variable that stores the composed message.

// We then use string interpolation to compose the message by combining the famous_person, " once said, ",
//  and the quote variables. The resulting message is stored in the message variable.

//  Finally, we use console.log() to print the message.
