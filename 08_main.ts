// Question 9

let favertNumber: number = 1;
console.log(`my favert number is ${favertNumber}`);

// In this code, we have a favoriteNumber variable that stores your favorite number is 1.

// We then use string interpolation to create the message variable, which includes your favorite number. 
// The ${favoriteNumber} placeholder is used to insert the value of the favoriteNumber variable into the message.

// Finally, we use console.log() to print the message variable.
