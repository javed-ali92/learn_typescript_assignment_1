// Question 4

let qoute: string = "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new";
let author: string = "Albert Einstein once said";
console.log(`"${author}" - ${qoute}`);

// In this code, we have a quote variable that stores the famous quote, 
// and an author variable that stores the name of the author.

// We then use console.log() to print the quote and author in the desired format. 
// The quote is enclosed in double quotation marks using string interpolation ("${quote}"), 
// and the author variable is included before the quote using string interpolation as well.
