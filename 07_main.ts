// Question 7 & 8

console.log(5 + 3) 
console.log(11 - 3)
console.log(4 * 2)
console.log(16 / 2)

// In this code, we have four print statements that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations resulting in the number 8.

// The addition operation 5 + 3 adds 5 and 3, resulting in 8.

// The subtraction operation 10 - 2 subtracts 2 from 10, resulting in 8.

// The multiplication operation 4 * 2 multiplies 4 and 2, resulting in 8.

// The division operation 16 / 2 divides 16 by 2, resulting in 8.

// Each operation is enclosed in a console.log() statement, which prints the result of the operation.
